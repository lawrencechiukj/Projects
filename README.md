# Machine Learning Project Examples
This repository contains IPython notebooks displaying some example projects of the machine learning frameworks and algorithms I adopted before. 

[1. Use Keras LSTM to conduct sentiment classfication on IMDB moive reviews](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lawrencechiukj/machine-learning-project-examples/blob/master/imdb-reviews-sentiment-classification.ipynb) (inspired by and modified from deeplearning.ai Emojify project)

[2. Use Keras CNN to conduct image classfication on flower image dataset](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lawrencechiukj/machine-learning-project-examples/blob/master/flower-image-classification.ipynb) (inspired by and modified from deeplearning.ai happyhouse project)

[3. Use Pandas and SKlearn to predict spotify pop song's popularity](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lawrencechiukj/machine-learning-project-examples/blob/master/spotify-song-popularity-prediction.ipynb)
