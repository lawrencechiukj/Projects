# Machine Learning Project Examples
This repository contains IPython notebooks displaying some example projects for the machine learning frameworks and algorithms I adopted before. 
1. Use Keras LSTM to conduct sentiment classfication on IMDB Moive Reviews (inspired by and modified from deeplearning.ai Emojify project)
2. Use Keras CNN to conduct image classfication on flower image dataset (inspired by and modified from deeplearning.ai happyhouse project)
